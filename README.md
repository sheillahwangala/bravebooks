##  1. <a name='Description'></a>Description
BraveBooks is a web application responsible for provision of e-library services. E-books are added by uploading in the `Add Book` section. A reader signs into the web app to read available books.

###  3.1. <a name='Requirements'></a>Requirements
For a user to acces the e-books, read books and add new books to the library, they need:

            A powered working computer, smartphone, tablet or ipad.

            Access to working Internet connection.
###  3.2. <a name='Process'></a>Process
To install this app:
                ~ Clone this app from github using my ssh key: git@github.com:sheillahwangala/bravebooks.git
                ~ In your code editor,  run "mpm install" to download all its dependancies
                ~ Then run "npm start" to start the react app
##  4. <a name='Technology'></a>Technology
The app is working with a json-server as it's backend To run it, you need to install json-server by running *npm install -g json-server*, then keeping it live by running *json-server --watch db.json*
This is a web application whose structure has been built using React native, a javascript library for the repsonsiveness of the features. Boostrap was then used to style the pages.

##  5. <a name='FutureDevelopments'></a>Future Developments
        I hope to build the app again with inclusion of back-end server using ruby in future.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
